# Site building sandbox

This is where I try out different things in html, css and JS in order to learn how to code and to develop webpages by implementing things 
that I have learnt or am learning relating to building structure with html implementing styling with css and adding an interactive aspect 
to the site via JS. This is a non serious project and it doesn't matter how it looks or how well it works... Well up to a point, I want 
stuff to work and I don't want it to look too awful!
